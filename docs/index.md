# Home Cluster

Welcome to the docs on my home Kubernetes cluster.

## Story

Two years ago my homelab setup was very different that what it is today. I was running a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) cluster and doing deployments with [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/). While this was working, I was unsure about Docker Swarm's future and I was also looking at a better way to handle application updates. I knew I wanted to keep using open source software and decided it was a good time to start getting familiar with Kubernetes... in came k3s.

### k3s

[k3s](https://k3s.io/) comes with a very low barrier to entry in getting a Kubernetes cluster running. After deploying it with [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup) I fell in love with the simplicity and love the single binary approach. With k3sup the time it took from getting a Kubernetes cluster up and running was literally minutes. Without much Kubernetes knowledge this allowed me to teardown the cluster and install it again, each time learning new things like how to deploy applications with [Helm](https://helm.sh/), set up a load balancer using [Metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/), how to handle ingress and storage.

### Flux

After awhile of tinkering with k3s, I started reading up on GitOps principles and fell in love with the idea of having a Git repository drive a Kubernetes cluster state. No more missing configuration files, backing up compose files in fear of losing them. I could have mostly everything Kubernetes cares about tracked in a Git repo, while having an operator running in my cluster reading from my Git repo.

This is where [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) comes into play. Flux is an awesome tool that syncs my Git repo with my cluster. Any change I make in my Git repo will be directly applied by Flux in my Kubernetes cluster.

### Renovate

So I have my cluster running, I have Flux running inside and it is synced to my Git repository. How do I handle application updates? Flux has this built into their application using the [image-automation-controller](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/components/image/controller/) but I am not a fan of having applications auto-update. Sometimes I want to read application changelogs or review source code before I commit to upgrading.

I decided that [Renovate](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate) would be a good solution to my problem. Renovate works by scanning my Git repository and offering changes in the form of a pull request when a new container image update or helm chart update is found.

### Conclusion

Overall I am very happy being off my Portainer/Docker Swarm cluster and finally using Kubernetes. The road was rocky but with passion and perseverance I was able to reach my goal.

It should go without saying a lot of what is built upon here is not only my ideas. A lot of work is being done by other people in the k8s@home community.
